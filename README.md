# Drupal Events Module â€“ Dual Implementation

This repository contains a **Drupal project** showcasing two different approaches to building an **Events module**. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate flexibility in Drupal's architecture by implementing similar functionality using:

1. **Standard Drupal Content Tools (Content Types, Views, Taxonomy, etc.)**
2. **A Custom Module (Manual Handling of Everything â€“ Models, Forms, Routing, Config, History)**

## ðŸ§© Module Overview

### âœ… 1. Standard Drupal Implementation

This approach leverages built-in Drupal features to create and manage events quickly using the UI and minimal custom code.

**Key Features:**
- **Content Type**: `Event` with fields like title, description, start date, and end date , taxonomy (category) ,images.
- **Views**: Configured to display a list of upcoming/past events.
- **Block Content**: Used for placing events list or calendar in predefined regions.
- **Taxonomy**: Categories used to classify events.
- **.module File**: Contains custom **form validation logic** for event submissions (e.g., end date must be greater than the start date ).

### ðŸ›  2. Custom Model-Based Implementation

This approach demonstrates a **custom-built module** where the entire event management system is created manually, offering full control and customizability.

**Key Features:**
- **Custom Database Tables**: Events,Event Images  ,Categoris,,Configurations, and Configuration Logs.
- **Custom Forms**: Manual forms built using Drupal Form API for:
  - Creating events
  - Setting up configurations
  - Logging changes to configurations
- **Config Management**:
  - Custom configuration entity or table to store module settings
  - History of edits (what data changed, when, and by whom)
- **Routing**:
  - `/categories` â€” List all categories
  - `/categories/add` â€” add new category
  - `/categories/id/delete` â€” delete category
  - `/categories/id/edit` â€” edit category
  - `/events` â€” List all events
  - `/events/add` â€” Form to add new events
  - `/events/{id}/view` â€” view  event
  - `/events/{id}/update` â€” Form to update existing events
  - `/events/{id}/delete` â€” Form to delete events
  - `/events/config` â€” Configuration form
  - `/events/config/log` â€” View the history of configuration changes
    //for content type events
   -/main-events2 -list all events created by content type
   -/node/add/main_events -add new content type of type main events
   -/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/category/add - add new category taxonomy  
- **Validation**: Manual validation within the form classes
- **Access Control**: Users can access these routes after module installation and cache rebuild.
